<h2>Is the Google Assistant for Android Devices good or not?</h2><br/>
My opinion:<br/>
It is good in a few ways:<br/>
1. It's useful for calling, checking the weather, time, alarms and other stuff hands-free.<br/>
2. It can remember stuff that you said to it followed by "Remember that..."<br/>
3. It has the Shortcut Feature that you can for example shortcut "Play Workout Music on Google Play Music" to "Workout Music"<br/>
4. With specific tools you can operate your whole home with it<br/>
<br/>
But, as every software, it has some flaws. Google Assistant has these:<br/>
1. It cannot be used without having the screen turned on<br/>
2. The Voice Match feature can unlock the phone with just a recording of your voice<br/>
3. It doesn't understand a lot of things, it's not as advanced as f.e Siri<br/>
4. It cannot lock the phone with a command<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is...<br/>
6/10.<br/>
As every software, Google Assistant has flaws.<br/>
However the assistant has quite alot of them, there are more flaws that I didn't cover here.<br/>
