<h4>
To inject <u>any</u> hacked save, you need root access.<br/>
If you do have root access, follow these steps:<br/>
1. Install any file manager that has access to root/system files.<br/>
2. Go to the last directory possible<br/>
3. Go to "data" folder<br/>
4. Go to "data" folder again<br/>
5. Search for "com.android.egg"<br/>
6. From "com.android.egg" go to shared_prefs<br/>
7. Copy the mPrefs.xml file to your Internal Storage/sdcard.<br/>
8. Connect your phone to your computer through a cable<br/>
9. Copy the mPrefs.xml file from your internal storage/sdcard to your Desktop<br/>
10. Open the file with any text editing software (I recommend Notepad++)<br/>
11. Remove all lines that begin with <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> (<u>BUT NOT ANY OTHERS!</u>)<br/>
12. Now go to the line where all the <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>s began and paste your Hacked Save.<br/>
13. Save the file<br/>
14. Delete the original mPrefs.xml from your Internal Storage/sdcard.<br/>
15. Copy the modified file to your Internal Storage/sdcard.<br/>
16. In your phone, through a file manager move the mPrefs.xml file to where it originally was.<br/>
17. Make sure you followed all the steps carefully and check your cats.<br/>
18. Enjoy your hacked save!<br/>
